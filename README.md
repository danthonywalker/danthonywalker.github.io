## Welcome to danthonywalker's GitHub Page

I am a 21 year old Software Engineer in Southwest Idaho who specializes in JVM-centric languages (such as Java and Kotlin). I am also fluent in C, Rust, and JavaScript with an added ability of quickly adopting a new language thanks to years of exposure from other language and library design elements.

### Projects

* [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J) - I am a primary contributor of the repository and administrator of the community. My duties include development of the user-facing API, managing pull requests, addressing issues, writing documentation (including READMEs, Javadocs, and the Wiki), moderating and participating in the community, and working with a team of talented individuals to accomplish the aforementioned tasks. We strive to provide a perfect API to suit all of our user's needs and requirements.

* [NeonTech](https://github.com/NeonTech/) - I am the owner of the organization. In the future, its goals are to provide an assortment of libraries and applications to allow engaging interactions between Discord users and supported game titles. It is also a staging ground for many experimental designs that may be useful to the broader programming community such as [Shielder](https://github.com/NeonTech/Shielder).
